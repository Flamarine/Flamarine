* I am currently doing Minecraft modding (Most of the time I make mods with [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/)/[QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org/) toolchain, sometimes also [Forge](https://www.minecraftforge.net/) or [NilLoader](https://git.sleeping.town/unascribed/NilLoader)).
* I love to use [yarn](https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn) as deobfuscation mappings, even when modding in Forge (I use [Architectury Loom](https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom) instead of [ForgeGradle](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle)).
* I love using MIT License or WTFPL License as the open-source licenses in my project.
* I kinda dislike those who use ARR all the time.
* I am currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
  * I use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) + [IntelliJ Rust](https://intellij-rust.github.io/) as my Rust IDE.
* My favorite JVM programming language is [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), though I use [Java](https://www.java.com/) more.
* I've learned [C++](https://isocpp.org/), however I don't use it often.
* I love [Frums](https://soundcloud.com/frums) and their music.
* ~~Seriously, why can a human design such dumb things like ForgeGradle?~~
