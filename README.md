Greetings from a senior high student aged 16. I...

* ...play Arknights, Minecraft, Death Stranding and some other games.
* ...am currently a Minecraft modder (Most of the time I make mods with [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/)/[QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org/) toolchain, sometimes also [Forge](https://www.minecraftforge.net/) or [NilLoader](https://git.sleeping.town/unascribed/NilLoader)).
* ...am an absolute [Yarn](https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn) fan.
* ...love using MIT License or WTFPL License as the open-source licenses in my project.
* ...kinda dislike those who use ARR all the time.
* ...am currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
  * I use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) + [IntelliJ Rust](https://intellij-rust.github.io/) as my Rust IDE.
  * Though, I'm also interested in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), HolyC，[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and several functional programming languages (e.g. Haskell).
* ...love and am learning [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), though I use [Java](https://www.java.com/) more.
* ...have learned [C++](https://isocpp.org/), however I almost never use it because manual memory allocating is so dumb.
* ...love [Frums](https://soundcloud.com/frums) and their music.
* ...sometimes play rhythm games (mostly Arcaea).
* ...am an absolute [EMI](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/emi) fan. Don't even ask me to make REI compat in my mods, I use EMI only :)
